The colonization was marked by repression, exploitation, and resistance from the Algerian population. The colonization deeply impacted Algerian society and laid the groundwork for future political struggles.\nIndependence Movement: The struggle for independence gained momentum in the 20th century, led by figures like Emir Abdelkader and later, the National Liberation Front (FLN). The Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962) was a brutal conflict between the FLN and French forces, resulting in Algeria's independence on July 5, 1962.\nPost-Independence Era (1962-present):\nSingle Party Rule (1962-1989): After independence, the FLN became the dominant political party and established a socialist government. Ahmed Ben Bella became Algeria's first president, followed by Houari Boumediene.\nSocialist Period (1962-1988): Under Boumediene's rule, Algeria pursued a socialist economic model, nationalizing industries and implementing land reforms. However, political freedoms were limited, and dissent was suppressed.\nCivil War (1991-2002): In 1991, Algeria held its first multi-party elections. The Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) won the first round, but the military intervened, leading to the cancellation of the elections and the declaration of a state of emergency. This sparked a brutal civil war between Islamist insurgents and the government, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths.\nPolitical Reforms (2000s): President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who came to power in 1999, initiated political reforms in the 2000s, including amendments to the constitution and amnesty for some rebel groups.\nArab Spring (2011): Algeria experienced protests during the Arab Spring, prompting Bouteflika to announce political reforms and lifting the state of emergency. However, the government's response to the protests was mostly repressive.\nBouteflika's Resignation (2019): Mass protests erupted in 2019, demanding Bouteflika's resignation due to allegations of corruption and his inability to govern due to health issues. Bouteflika resigned in April 2019.\nOngoing Challenges: Algeria continues to face challenges related to political stability, economic reforms, youth unemployment, and demands for greater democratic freedoms.

Movements such as the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA), and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) emerged to fight against Portuguese colonial rule.\nIndependence (1975): Angola finally gained independence from Portugal on November 11, 1975. However, the country immediately plunged into a civil war as the MPLA, UNITA, and FNLA vied for power. The MPLA, led by Agostinho Neto, emerged as the dominant party and established a socialist government with the support of Cuba and the Soviet Union.\nCivil War (1975-2002): The civil war in Angola was one of the longest and most devastating conflicts in Africa. It was primarily fought between the MPLA government and UNITA rebels, with various factions and external powers involved. The conflict caused widespread destruction, displacement, and loss of life, severely impacting Angola's development.\nPeace Process and Reconstruction: The civil war officially ended in 2002 with the death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi. This paved the way for a peace agreement between the MPLA government and UNITA, leading to a period of reconstruction and reconciliation. Angola focused on rebuilding its infrastructure, economy, and institutions with the help of oil revenues, as Angola is one of Africa's leading oil producers.\nPost-War Politics: Since the end of the civil war, Angola has been dominated by the MPLA party.

Dahomey became a French colony in 1904 and was subsequently integrated into French West Africa.\nColonial Rule: Under French colonial rule, Benin's economy was largely oriented towards the production of cash crops such as palm oil, cotton, and cocoa. The French implemented policies of forced labor and taxation, which sparked resistance and revolts among the local population.\nIndependence Movement: The struggle for independence gained momentum in the mid-20th century, inspired by movements across Africa.

Khoisan-speaking (Khoe and San) peoples have been indigenous to this land for 40,000 years and have worked historically as hunters, gatherers, and herders, though some converted to pastoralism (raising livestock) in the last centuries before the Common Era. Bantu-speaking farmers migrated from the equator around 20 BCE, and, starting in the 13th century, the rise of significant dynasties from the Bantu-speaking Tswana people took over after several hundred years of various chiefdom cultures throughout the east and west of the country. As trading began on African coasts around 1750, war and migration followed among military states until the 1840s. \n\nProminent kings such as Sechele and Khama III ruled in the mid-to-late 19th century, and they grappled with what would become the British protectorate (a state that is controlled or protected by another) in the country after white invaders inundated Botswana starting in 1867 for gold mining. Once the entire continent was ‘carved up’ in the European ‘scramble’ of the 1880s, Germany colonized almost all of central and southern Africa; Botswana is called the ‘Bechuanaland Protectorate’ until its independence. However, the British Cape Colony far south controlled roads through Tswana states for missionaries and trade, and this would help them proclaim their protectorate over much of this land in 1885 and 1890. At this time, many indigenous peoples would come to find their ancestral lands stolen by these white invaders, a practice that would go on – even under the future independent government – through the 21st century. \n\nIn the early 20th century, the British speculated how to release Botswana from its control under the tense climate of rising apartheid in South Africa and conflict over the rising leader and future president (descended from Khama III) Sereste Khama’s marriage to a British woman. In the meantime, Khama was exiled for six years in 1950 because of his marriage and refusal to recuse leadership. Soon after, Khama’s supporters began organizing themselves in opposition, and Botswana’s national spirit bloomed. In the late 50s, it was clear that the country would need to become independent. After political parties such as the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) arose and limited elections were held, the country became self-governing in 1965. The following year what was once ‘Bechuanaland’ was now the Republic of Botswana under a BDP government led by Sereste Khama as its first president. \nOver the next several years, Botswana transitioned as a newly independent state, focused on becoming a “nonracial, liberal democratic alternative to South African apartheid.” The founding of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in 1974, a coalition of most southern states seeking to bring majority rule to the region brought this goal into action. By that time, the country’s economy got a crucial boost lasting decades from South African geologist Manfred Marx’s discovery of the Orapa diamond mine in 1967; the BDP party held onto leadership throughout that time. \n\nSignificant struggles mark the late 20th century in Botswana; after Sereste Khama died in 1980, the early ’90s saw the country grapple with AIDS and human rights concerns over accusations of torture against the indigenous San people as the government forcibly removed them from their ancestral lands, while barring the San from hunting. The government handled the former by becoming the first African country to provide free HIV medication to all citizens. The latter is still a struggle for justice as recently as 2014, with Amnesty International and the UN, among many others calling for the government to commit fully to high court rulings by allowing the San full access to their land and way of life. \nToday, Botswana has its struggles and victories; in 2010, the leading BDP split after current president Mokgweetsi Masisi moved away from the party’s policies, and his predecessor Ian Khama threw support behind new political factions. Furthermore, as Africa’s largest diamond producer, it has discovered what is thought to be the world’s second and third largest diamonds in the world, with the latter uncovered in 2021. However, some note that its diamond-focused economy is slowing, and the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased GDP. In any case, Botswana continues to develop.","Flag File":"flag_Botswana"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[25.911948,-24.646314]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Capital Id":5.0,"Capital Name":"Ouagadougou","Country Name":"Burkina Faso","Country Color":"#FCAB10","Longitude":-1.52667,"Latitude":12.37226,"Capital Information":"Colonial Period: Burkina Faso was colonized by France in the late 19th century as part of French West Africa.

Major ethnic groups such as the Twa, Hutu, and Tutsi originated in the historic Kingdom of Burundi, an empire that was founded around the early 16th century. The Mwamis (kings) used their high authoritative power to oversee both the land and all economic exchanges. This led to great growth in the kingdom throughout its time, enticing Europeans to begin making brief visits in the middle of the 19th century. After the Germans claimed the area in 1890, there was an agreement to allow King Mwezi IV Gisabo to continue his reign until 1908.\n\nDuring the first World War, Germany lost their rule after a takeover from Belgian troops (who came in from the neighboring Congo). In 1923, the Belgians took after Tutsi culture to use indirect rule for administration of their new territory (at first called “Ruanda-Urundi”). While under Belgium rule, the Burundians faced issues regarding having their culture ignored largely by their new European leaders. This led to a strong desire for independence, and in 1958, the political party Unity for National Progress (UPRONA) was founded. During the next legislative election in 1961, UPRONA’s Tutsi Prince Louis Rwagasore was the victor; sadly, he was assassinated shortly after.\n\nHowever, the stride to independence continued. Burundi gained independence from Belgium on July 1, 1962. Unfortunately, since gaining their independence, this country has faced great turmoil, instability, and violence. The Burundi Killings of 1972 were devastating: there were an estimated 150,000-300,000 victims during this massive, ongoing attack in which Tutsi and Hutu were both the victims and perpetrators. Melchoir Ndadaye, the first Hutu president of Burundi (elected in 1991), had promising expectations towards a non-ethnic government that could help relieve the violence between the two ethnic groups. However, he was assassinated in 1993, and a civil war soon followed.

Rabah Zubar Fadlallah, a former slave turned warlord, conquered empire after empire until he had complete control of the Northern area (now known as Chad) in 1894. During Rabah’s reign, French expeditionary forces were sent to begin colonization of the area. Rabah refused to step down; in 1899, Rabah won a battle against the French attempting to colonize. \n\nThis initial loss only made the French continue their colonial conquest more relentlessly.

Early inhabitants of Gabon were settlers from the Baka tribe, settlers who survived largely from the rainforest. (Tribes of Baka still remain in modern Gabon today, although they are facing a serious threat with the destruction of rainforests.) Gabon was given its name in reference to the shape of the Rio de Como estuary (where saltwater meets river water), which reminded the Portuguese explorers of a hooded cloak called the “gaboa”. Portuguese settlers arrived in Gabon's land as early as 1472; once they arrived, sugar plantations and trading practices were established. Slave trade was a large development between the foreign competitors that had also come into the area. One of the more prominent Baka tribes, the Mpongwe clan, greatly benefited from slavery; however, the French sought to abolish slavery to focus on more commercial trades. Around 1839, there was an agreement between leaders of the French and Mpongwe tribes: the slave trade came to an end, and rule over the land was granted to France. \n\nAlthough France had sovereignty of Gabon since the early 19th century, Gabon officially joined the French Equatorial Africa in 1910. Initially, there wasn’t much opposition with the French’s government. However, issues such as forced labor, taxes, and trade interferences pushed for an independence movement, which was led by two political leaders Leon M’ba and Jean-Hilaire Aubame (of the Gabon Democractic Bloc and Gabonese branch of the Party of African Reunion, respectively). In 1958, Gabon gained a step closer to independence by becoming an autonomous republic in the French Community, and on August 17, 1960, the country declared its independence from France.\n\nEven while embracing their new independence, Gabon remained influenced by French culture and maintained an amicable relationship with France. This good-standing with France was especially important for the first president, Leon M’ba; after a brief military rebellion, President M’ba reclaimed his presidential authority by having French forces intervene. After President M’ba passed away in 1967, he was succeeded by Vice President Omar Bongo. President Bongo served as Gabon’s president for four decades, granting him the title of the world’s longest serving head of government. During his reign, President Bongo was praised for the peace that the country maintained, despite having a variety of ethnic groups. On the downside, he was also criticized for his mishandling of the country’s oil wealth (although Gabon has a rich source of oil, most of the population is considered to be poor).\n\nAfter President Bongo’s death in 2009, his son Ali Bongo Ondimba was elected president. Majority of President Ali Bongo’s presidency has been focused on a long-running French investigation concerning fraud and embezzlement of family assets; nonetheless, President Ali Bongo was reelected for president in 2016, and has been carrying out his term since. Despite having a third of its population live in poverty, Gabon remains rich in its natural resources. Gabon is considered to be one of the more stable Central African countries.

The empire contained self-governing factions that maintained their autonomy even as the Portuguese attempted to colonize them in the 16th century. This was eventually stopped through the aggressive increase in the slave trade that occurred primarily between 1790 and 1860. This occurred before the British colonized Malawi in 1891.\n\nWhen the British colonized Malawi they created the “Nyasaland Districts Protectorate” also known as the “British Central Africa Protectorate”. The influence the colonization had on the people of Malawi consisted of the Roman Catholic Church building roads and railways, and the introduction to the cultivation of cash crops by the Europeans. However, the African agricultural growth that was once thriving had started to deplete. The British destroyed the agricultural progress of the Malawians and built plantations, where they grew cash crops and thrived from their coffee crops. Malawians were now out of jobs and the only way they were able to work was if they worked on coffee plantations or left their homeland and went to neighboring countries to find better work and normally  Under these very difficult political and social conditions, Malawians continued to work but eventually the forced labor, racial discrimination, and mistreatment from the British led to a revolt in 1915. John Chilembwe, followed by 200 Malawians, aimed to murder all male Europeans. They successfully murdered 3 before John attempted to flee to Mozambique and was murdered by the African “Askari Military Patrol”. Despite this setback, Malawians gained their independence on July 6th, 1964, as a member of the “Commonwealth of Nations”.

After a series of violent acts between Europeans and pro-independence Malawians, Dr. Banda was able to speak with people in London to assure the independence of Malawi. After becoming independent, Dr. Banda went on to become the president of Malawi, with a life term when the country became a Republic (1966-71). After claiming their independence a disagreement erupted between Banda, the prime minister, and the majority of his cabinet members. The majority of cabinet members and the prime minister  challenged Dr. Banda’s autocratic methods and his support of  Apartheid in South Africa and the Portuguese colonies. Eventually, this resulted in the dismissal of three cabinet members, and three others left in protest. After being elected, Banda quickly started improving the nation’s economy. Banda continued to grow cash crops and created the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC). Banda improved the economy by creating the Southern African Development Community so fewer people would have to rely on the government’s social program.  Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC) financed various projects in agriculture and animal husbandry, energy, mining, disease control, telecommunications, and regional trade.\n\n. \n\nPresident Banda ended his election term 3 years before he died because he was voted out within the country’s first multiparty presidential elections in 1994. Starting in 1995, Malawi transitioned from an autocratic leadership to a democracy. Bakili Muzuli won the presidency for two 5 year terms (1994-2004) against the political party, The United Democratic Front. Muzuli worked to instill a democratic government and freedom of speech. Despite his good intentions, he was attacked by the Malawian citizens for being autocratic. In the last fifteen years, the country has to overcome issues of famine and HIV and AIDS. The famine that occurred in 2002 was devastating to the country and the international aid arrived slowly. The famine eventually did get better in 2007, as the citizens of Malawi were reliant on food aid, in time, they were able to make a profit to support the country and others around it. They exported maize for profit and donated maize to other countries in need; Zimbabwe imported 40,000 metric tons of maize from them, along with Lesotho and Swaziland, receiving 5,000 metric tons of maize each. Later on, the government was accused of selling grain from the country’s reserves at a profit to themselves prior to the onset of the famine.  HIV/AIDS began to spread and was uncontrollable up until about 2015-2020 when the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan implemented prevention policies for reducing new HIV infections. Malawi found a solution to every problem which shows the resiliency of the country to overcome adversity.","Flag File":"flag_Malawi"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[33.783302,-13.983295]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Capital Id":32.0,"Capital Name":"Bamako","Country Name":"Mali","Country Color":"#FCAB10","Longitude":-8.00199,"Latitude":12.65196,"Capital Information":"\nPre-Colonial Empires: Mali has a long history of ancient civilizations and empires, including the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire, and the Songhai Empire.

The French established control over the territory for its resources and strategic importance, imposing their language, culture, and governance structures on the local population. Mali was known as French Sudan during this period.\n\nIndependence Movement: The struggle for independence gained momentum in the mid-20th century, inspired by anti-colonial movements across Africa. The Sudanese Union - African Democratic Rally (US-RDA), led by Modibo Keïta, emerged as a leading force in the independence movement in Mali. Keïta's government advocated for socialism and Pan-Africanism.\n\nIndependence (1960): Mali gained independence from France on September 22, 1960, becoming the Republic of Mali. Modibo Keïta became the country's first President. Mali adopted a socialist-oriented economic policy and pursued close ties with other newly independent African nations and the Soviet bloc.\n\nKeïta's Government (1960-1968): Modibo Keïta's government implemented socialist policies, including nationalization of key industries, land reforms, and centralized planning. However, his presidency was marked by authoritarianism, political repression, and economic mismanagement. Mali's economy struggled, and tensions grew between Keïta's government and opposition groups.\n\nMilitary Rule (1968-1991): In 1968, Modibo Keïta's government was overthrown in a military coup led by Lieutenant Moussa Traoré. Traoré established a military regime and ruled Mali for over two decades with an iron fist. His government suppressed political opposition, restricted civil liberties, and maintained tight control over the economy.\n\nTransition to Democracy (1990s): In the early 1990s, Mali underwent a process of political liberalization and democratization in response to domestic and international pressure.

However, Morocco could not keep up with the demands of the growing economy, which led to a government collapse. France’s conquest of Morocco began in 1907 after a French doctor named Emile Mauchamp was assassinated in Marrakesh by a Moroccan mob. Mauchamp, who ran a pharmacy in Morocco, was accused of having harmful Christian views and it was also rumored that he was a spy. It is argued that local Moroccans thought that a pole installed on the roof of Mauchamp’s pharmacy was equipment used for his alleged spy operations and therefore he was murdered by a Moroccan mob as a “political act of resistance” against increasing French power in Morocco. \n \nMorocco became “French Morocco” in 1912 after a treaty called the Treaty of Fes was declared between France and Morocco. The treaty gave France political power over non-Moroccan citizens, leaving Moroccan citizens still under Moroccan government control. A zone of the northern part of Morocco became Spanish Morocco after Spain signed a treaty with France. Morocco made several rebellious attempts to break away from France and Spain and was finally granted independence from both countries in 1956. \n  \n \nYears of political unrest and change followed after Morocco’s independence from France and Spain. Morocco was ruled by the King of Morocco, King Hassan II, from 1961-1999. During this time, Hassan II introduced “Moroccanization” of the economy, in which any foreign-owned land, businesses and assets that were more than fifty percent owned by the French or other foreign countries were distributed to Moroccans, particularly “political loyalists and high-ranking military officers.” Moroccan-owned businesses jumped from 18 to 55 percent and two-thirds of the new economy’s wealth was held in about 36 families. \n \nCrown Prince Sidi Mohammed became the king of Morocco as Mohammed VI after King Hassan II died in 1999.

This country was named after the Niger (“river among rivers”) River, which served as an essential economic crossroad for its flow through the southwestern region of the land. Due to the importance of the river, this area has a history of kingdoms such as Songhai, Mali, Gao, Kanem, and Bornu. One of the most notable ethnic groups was the Tuareg tribe; these inhabitants had emerged as nomads following “desertification” (a process during which a habitat is drastically changed). This indigenous tribe ruled over most of Niger’s northern area, and their culture remains in modern Niger today. This was also one of the last ethnic groups that rebelled against colonization by Europeans; they unfortunately fell under the claim of French explorers in the early 20th century.\n\nWhen Europeans began their conquest of the Niger area, they were especially interested in finding the source of the Niger River. After Niger was formally colonized in 1922, the French named Niamey as the colonial capital in 1926 (Niamey remains the capital of Niger today). This was in part due to its location along the Niger River. Despite being in an area essential for trade, issues such as poorly-conditioned roads and few railroad connections caused problems for various markets. This, along with effects of the French’s limited citizenship for Africans, played a role in Niger becoming an autonomous republic in the French Community in 1958. On August 3, 1960, Niger gained independence from France; afterwards, Hamani Diori was elected the country’s first president. \n\nIndependence was unfortunately followed by a time of dictatorship under President Diori’s leadership. In 1974, President Diori was overthrown by a military coup; afterwards, there was a period of military rule under the leaders Seyni Kountche and Ali Seibou (1974-1987 and 1987-1993, respectively). After a few years that included a multi-party election, another brief military rule, and the assassination of President Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, the National Reconciliation Council spearheaded a nine-month transitional government plan. This resulted in the return of a democratic government, led by Mamadou Tandja of the National Movement of a Developing Society-Nassara, who was elected president of Niger in 1999.\n\nWhile President Tandja was at first praised for bringing stability to politics in Niger, he was also criticized for his efforts to alter the democratic process to change his presidential terms and limitations for his benefit.

The Tutsis (the minority), were favored highly; this caused a tension to build between the two ethnic groups. Hutus began to form political parties to change their power status, and the Party of the Hutu Emancipation won legislative elections in 1960 and 1961. On July 1, 1962, Rwanda became an independent country with Gregorie Kayibanda, a Hutu, as their president.\n\nAs Hutus began to gain more political and social power, tensions continued to rise with the Tutsis (many of whom had fled the country following independence). From 1990-1993, the Hutu government engaged in a war with the Rwandan Patriotic Front (Tutsi rebels). In 1994, a peace agreement was signed between the two; within the same year, President Juvenal-Habyarimana (a Hutu politician elected in 1978) was assassinated when his plane was shot down. It’s still not entirely clear on who was responsible for the assassination, but nonetheless, the Hutus took it as a cause to start the mass killing of the minority Tutsis. The Rwanda Genocide was one of the deadliest, strategic mass muders to ever happen; 800,000 to 1 million Tutsis were slaughtered by Hutu government and milita. In retaliation, the RPF launched their own attack on the government. 100 days after the genocide began, RPF defeated the government. In 2000, the leader of RPF, Paul Kagame, became president.\n\nPresident Kagame continues to run Rwanda today with a mix of equal praise and criticism. While he has put in great effort to rebuild the country after the horrific tragedy, he has done so by inciting violence and creating an authoritarian government. Nonetheless, Rwanda has seen a great deal of progress from their troubled past; there are implements of power-sharing in order to reduce ethnic conflict, the economy has grown, and there are less HIV and child mortality rates. With a strong history of violence caused by internal ethnic conflicts, Rwanda is making peace of their priorities as they continue to form good internal relations.","Flag File":"flag_Rwanda"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[30.058586,-1.951644]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Capital Id":41.0,"Capital Name":"São Tomé","Country Name":"Sao Tome and Principe","Country Color":"#FCAB10","Longitude":6.73333,"Latitude":0.3334,"Capital Information":"Colonial Era. São Tomé and Príncipe, located off the coast of West Africa, were uninhabited islands until they were discovered by Portuguese explorers in the late 15th century. The Portuguese established sugar plantations on the islands and imported slaves from mainland Africa to work on the plantations. São Tomé and Príncipe became a major hub of the transatlantic slave trade.\n\nStruggle for Independence: The nationalist movement in São Tomé and Príncipe gained momentum in the mid-20th century, inspired by anti-colonial movements across Africa. The Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP), led by figures such as Manuel Pinto da Costa, emerged as the leading force in the independence struggle. MLSTP waged a peaceful campaign for self-rule and greater autonomy from Portuguese colonial rule.\n\nIndependence (1975): São Tomé and Príncipe gained independence from Portugal on July 12, 1975, following the Carnation Revolution in Portugal, which led to the collapse of the authoritarian Estado Novo regime and the decolonization of Portugal's African territories. Manuel Pinto da Costa became the country's first President, and the MLSTP formed the government.\n\nSingle-Party Rule: After independence, São Tomé and Príncipe was governed by the MLSTP as a single-party state.

Here's an overview:\n\nPre-Colonial Era: Somalia has a rich history of civilization and trade, with ancient city-states such as Mogadishu, Merca, and Zeila playing key roles in the Indian Ocean trade network. Somali society was organized into clans and kinship groups, with a tradition of pastoralism, agriculture, and maritime commerce.\n\nColonialism (Late 19th-20th Century): Somalia was colonized by European powers in the late 19th century, with different parts of the territory falling under British, Italian, and French control. The British established the protectorates of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland, while France controlled the territory of Djibouti. Colonial rule disrupted traditional Somali institutions and identities and contributed to social and political fragmentation.\n\nIndependence Struggle: The nationalist movement in Somalia gained momentum in the mid-20th century, inspired by anti-colonial movements across Africa. Somali nationalists, including figures such as Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan (\"MadMullah\") and Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, led campaigns for independence from British and Italian colonial rule. The Somali Youth League (SYL) emerged as the leading political organization advocating for self-rule and greater autonomy.\n\nIndependence (1960): Somalia gained independence from Britain and Italy on July 1, 1960, through the unification of British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland. The newly independent Republic of Somalia adopted a democratic constitution and held its first elections. Aden Abdullah Osman Daar became the country's first President.\n\nMilitary Rule (1969-1991): Somalia experienced a period of political instability and coups d'état in the 1960s, culminating in the military coup of 1969 led by General Mohamed Siad Barre. Siad Barre established a socialist dictatorship and ruled Somalia with an iron fist for over two decades. His regime suppressed dissent, abolished political parties, and centralized power in the hands of the state.\n\nCivil War and Collapse of the State (1991-2000): Somalia descended into a devastating civil war in 1991, following the collapse of Siad Barre's regime and the disintegration of the central government. Clan-based militias, warlords, and factional groups vied for power and control over territory, leading to widespread violence, displacement, and humanitarian crises. The country became a \"failedstate\" with no effective central authority.\n\nEmergence of Warlords and Transitional Governments: During the 1990s, Somalia was characterized by clan-based fiefdoms and the emergence of warlords who controlled different parts of the country. Efforts to establish transitional governments and restore stability, including the establishment of the Transitional National Government (TNG) and the Transitional Federal Government (TFG), were marred by internal divisions, external interference, and ongoing conflict.\n\nRise of Al-Shabaab and External Interventions: The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab emerged as a powerful actor in Somalia's conflict, seizing control of territory and waging a violent insurgency against the government and international forces. The African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), with support from the United Nations and Western powers, intervened to counter Al-Shabaab and stabilize the country.\n\nFederal Government and State-Building Efforts: In 2012, a new Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) was established, following a process of political reconciliation and the adoption of a new constitution.

Here's an overview:\n\nColonialism (17th-20th Century): South Africa was initially colonized by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century, followed by British colonial expansion in the 19th century. The British established control over the Cape Colony and subsequently extended their influence over other regions through wars, treaties, and annexations. Colonialism disrupted indigenous societies, imposed racial segregation, and exploited labor and natural resources.\n\nApartheid Era (1948-1994): Apartheid, a system of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination, was introduced by the National Party (NP) government in 1948. Apartheid laws enforced racial classification, restricted movement and residence, segregated public facilities, and denied political rights to non-white South Africans. The African National Congress (ANC), along with other anti-apartheid movements, led resistance against apartheid through protests, boycotts, strikes, and armed struggle.\n\nResistance and Repression: The apartheid regime responded to resistance with brutal repression, including massacres, arrests, torture, and censorship. The ANC and other liberation movements were banned, their leaders imprisoned or exiled, and their activities suppressed. The Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 and the Soweto Uprising in 1976 were turning points in the struggle against apartheid, drawing international condemnation and solidarity.\n\nInternational Isolation and Sanctions: South Africa faced increasing international isolation and condemnation for its apartheid policies. The United Nations imposed sanctions, and many countries, organizations, and individuals supported the anti-apartheid movement through boycotts, divestment, and diplomatic pressure. South Africa's sporting teams were excluded from international competitions, and cultural and academic exchanges were restricted.\n\nTransition to Democracy (1990-1994): In the late 1980s, amid internal unrest, economic pressure, and diplomatic isolation, the apartheid regime began negotiations with the ANC and other parties to dismantle apartheid and transition to democracy. In 1990, President F.W. de Klerk announced the unbanning of political organizations, including the ANC, and the release of Nelson Mandela after 27 years of imprisonment. Negotiations led to the adoption of a transitional constitution, multiracial elections, and the formation of a Government of National Unity.\n\nFirst Democratic Elections (1994): South Africa held its first democratic elections on April 27, 1994, which were open to all citizens regardless of race. The ANC, led by Nelson Mandela, won a landslide victory, and Mandela became the country's first black President. The transition to democracy was celebrated globally as a triumph over apartheid and a beacon of hope for reconciliation and nation-building.\n\nPost-Apartheid Reconstruction and Reconciliation: The post-apartheid era in South Africa has been characterized by efforts to address the legacy of apartheid, promote reconciliation, and build a democratic and inclusive society. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, investigated human rights abuses and atrocities committed during the apartheid era and provided a platform for victims and perpetrators to share their experiences.\n\nChallenges of Transformation: South Africa's transition to democracy has faced challenges, including socioeconomic inequalities, unemployment, poverty, crime, corruption, and political divisions. The ANC, which has been in power since 1994, has faced criticism for its handling of governance, service delivery, and accountability. The country has also grappled with issues such as land reform, education, healthcare, and HIV/AIDS.\n\nMulticultural Democracy. South Africa's political landscape is characterized by a vibrant democracy with a multiparty system, freedom of expression, and independent institutions. The country's diverse population includes various ethnic, linguistic, and cultural groups, with 11 official languages recognized in the constitution. The Constitution of South Africa, adopted in 1996, enshrines principles of human rights, equality, and social justice.\n\nGlobal Influence and Regional Leadership**: South Africa plays an influential role in regional and global affairs, serving as a mediator in conflicts, contributing to peacekeeping missions, and promoting development cooperation. The country is a member of the African Union (AU), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the BRICS grouping, and other international organizations.\n\nOverall, South Africa's political history reflects its journey from colonialism and apartheid to democracy and transformation.

South Sudan’s long, turbulent history begins in Sudan, the larger country that South Sudan would eventually succeed from. The Shilluk Kingdom (which would later become the third largest ethnic group in Sudan) was the first group of settlers to live in the area. They reigned over the land within their own systems for hundreds of years before colonization approached in the early 1800s. By then, the land now known as Sudan was conquered by Egyptians, who were also under the British's rule. The Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (established in 1899) allowed for Britain and Egypt to have a joint-ruling over Sudan; however, the British held the dominant authority. Due to the drastically different culture and practices in the north and south (such as modernization and religion), Sudan was governed as two separate regions. This tension in the difference of ruling measures would last well into modern times.\n\nBritain's rule in Sudan was relatively smooth (with the exception of a revolt in 1924), but the tides changed after World War II. The Sudanese had grown resentful of Britain’s lack of consulting in regards to official manners, and political parties formed as a source of representation. However, there was little participation from the southern region of Sudan in the efforts for independence. This especially became a problem when Arabic was named the official language of Sudan in 1947; the southern region’s primary language was English, and this limited their contribution to creating a new government. Despite these pressing issues, Sudan was granted independence on January 1, 1956. \n\nDispleased with the lack of autonomy they had, the country’s first civil war began in 1955 when Anya Nya (southern insurgents) started to fight against GOS (the government of Sudan). The 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement between the GOS and Southern Sudan Liberation Movement (formerly Anya Nya) brought the end of the war; unfortunately, that peace was short-lived when the Sudanese government reneged on promises for autonomy for the south. The country’s second civil war began in 1983 and lasted until 2005; this was far more deadlier than the first, ultimately resulting in the loss of two and a half million people and displacing another four million. The Nairobi Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed in 2005, granting the share of oil, a permanent ceasefire, and a six-year trial period of autonomy for the south.\n\nFollowing the six-year trial period, a referendum was held for elections on succeeding the south into its own country; on July 9, 2011, South Sudan became the world’s newest nation. Even while celebrating their long-awaited independence, lingering tension from succession still brought problems to the country. Conflict between the government and opposition forces has caused yet another civil war in 2013; as of 2018, a peace agreement promised the start of a transitional government. With the start date having recently been pushed to February 2020, South Sudan is still working on establishing that change. As a fresh new country, South Sudan is continuing to create a dream government out of the independence they have worked tirelessly for.","Flag File":"flag_South_Sudan"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[31.580026,4.829975]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Capital Id":51.0,"Capital Name":"Khartoum","Country Name":"Sudan","Country Color":"#FCAB10","Longitude":32.53223,"Latitude":15.59002,"Capital Information":"The pre-colonial era of Sudan began around the eighth millennium BCE in the Nile Valley with people who from a Neolithic culture. Those people lived in mud-brick villages and were hunters, fishers, gatherers of grain and cattle herders. By the fifth millennium BCE, neolithic people from the Sahara migrated to the Nile Valley, bringing with them agriculture. These two populations mixed together developed over centuries what is known as the Kingdom of Kush in 1700 BCE. The Kingdom of Kush, also called Nubia, was located along the Nile River and established after the crumbling of the Late Bronze Age and New Kingdom of Egypt. The Kingdom of Kush, which took rule over Egypt in 727 BCE, disintegrated until fourth century AD when Rome overpowered Egypt. The land where the Kingdom of Kush resided is the Northeast African country of Sudan today. \n \nThe Ottoman ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, conquered northern Sudan in 1821. As a result, the new government of the northern region of Sudan was led by Turkish regime. The regime did not expand to the southern part of Sudan due to dangerous swampland in the area. \nSudan was eventually overtaken by Britain and Egypt in 1899. The formation of the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium agreement that year solidified a dual colonial government rule in Sudan from 1899 to 1956, with Britain having full power and Egypt with local authority over the Sudanese.  \nDuring this time, most people in North Sudan were Islamic and spoke Arabic, while a variety of religions and languages spoken existed in the Southern part of the country. Until 1947, Britain aimed to separate both regions by enforcing a government-ruled school system in North Sudan and putting Christian missionaries in charge of education within South Sudan. \n\nSudan began its journey towards independence in 1954, with the launch of  first parliament in the country. In 1955, the first rebellion in South Sudan made way for the First Sudanese Civil war. The rebellion happened as a reaction from the Sudanese towards the British administration four months before gaining independence as the Republic of the Sudan on January 1, 1956. The First Sudanese Civil war lasted for 17 years, from 1955 to 1972. In 1958, a coup d’état to overthrow parliamentary rule took place in 1958 by Chief of Staff Major General Ibrahim Abboud. Abboud’s regime lasted until 1964. A second coup d’état, led by Colonel Gaafar Nimeiry, happened in 1969. Col. Nimeiry’s coup d’état was successful to the point where he not only became prime minister, but his regime put an end to parliament and all political parties. In 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement ended the First Sudanese Civil war. However, this treaty ended in 1983 after President Nimeiry proclaimed all of Sudan as an Islamic state under Sharia law. This act initiated the Second Sudanese Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2005. \n\nThe Second Sudanese Civil War ended in 2005, thanks to the signing of the Nairobi Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement. In 2006, the United Nations Security Council made plans to send a peacekeeping force of over 17,000 to Darfur, but the Government of the Sudan blocked this effort. The Government of the Sudan eventually  accepted this offer after increased global attention regarding the Darfur conflict and negotiation talks with the United Nations. The Darfur conflict ended in 2010 after a ceasefire agreement was signed between the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and Sudan’s government. In 2011, South Sudan became an independent nation.  \n\nSudan has still been plagued by internal conflict in the years following the end of the Darfur conflict. One of the most recent political setbacks was the December 2018 riots, which led to the Sudanese Revolution in 2019. Protests took place because of the government’s decision to triple the price of goods, such as bread, with a 70 percent inflation and shortage of foreign currency and fuel. The government was overthrown, President Omar al-Bashir was arrested and many people were also arrested and killed. The revolution ceased after the signing of the July 2019 Political Agreement and the August 2019 Draft Constitutional Declaration. \n\n\nThe Human Development Index Report of 2019 by the United National Development Programmed placed Sudan as number 168 in the “Low Human Development” portion of their list.

Here's an overview:\n\nColonialism (Late 19th-20th Century): Tanzania, then known as Tanganyika and Zanzibar, was colonized by various European powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The mainland territory of Tanganyika was controlled by Germany, while Zanzibar and Pemba were under the influence of the Sultanate of Oman and later Britain.\n\nStruggle for Independence: The nationalist movement in Tanganyika gained momentum in the mid-20th century, inspired by anti-colonial movements across Africa. The Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), led by Julius Nyerere, emerged as the leading political organization advocating for self-rule and independence from British colonial rule. TANU's slogan \"UhurunaUmoja\" (Freedom and Unity) became central to the independence struggle.\n\nIndependence (1961): Tanganyika gained independence from Britain on December 9, 1961, becoming a sovereign nation within the Commonwealth. Julius Nyerere became the country's first Prime Minister and later its first President after Tanganyika became a republic in 1962. Tanzania adopted a democratic constitution with provisions for multi-party elections, human rights, and socio-economic development.\n\nUnion with Zanzibar (1964): In 1964, Tanganyika united with Zanzibar to form the United Republic of Tanzania. The union was forged under the leadership of Julius Nyerere and Zanzibar's President, Abeid Karume, with the aim of promoting national unity, solidarity, and development. The merger of the two territories created a diverse and multiethnic nation with a unique political system.\n\nSocialist Policies and Ujamaa: Nyerere's government pursued socialist policies aimed at promoting social justice, economic equality, and self-reliance. The Arusha Declaration of 1967 outlined the principles of socialism and self-reliance, emphasizing collective ownership of land and resources, rural development, and community-based initiatives. The Ujamaa villages were established as a centerpiece of Tanzania's socialist development agenda.\n\nSingle-Party Rule (1977-1992): Tanzania was governed as a one-party state under the leadership of the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), the successor party to TANU. The CCM dominated Tanzanian politics, with Nyerere serving as President until 1985, followed by Ali Hassan Mwinyi. The single-party system was characterized by political stability, but also limitations on political pluralism and freedom of expression.\n\nTransition to Multi-Party Democracy: In the early 1990s, Tanzania underwent a process of political liberalization and democratization, following pressures for reform from domestic and international actors. President Ali Hassan Mwinyi initiated constitutional amendments that legalized opposition parties and paved the way for multi-party elections. The first multi-party elections since independence were held in 1995, leading to the peaceful transition of power to a coalition government led by the CCM.\n\nMulti-Party Democracy (1992-present): Tanzania's political landscape is characterized by a multi-party system, with the CCM and other political parties competing for power through regular elections. The country has held several presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, with power alternating between rival political parties. However, the CCM has remained the dominant political force, winning successive elections since the transition to multi-party democracy.\n\nChallenges and Opportunities: Tanzania faces a range of socio-economic and political challenges, including poverty, unemployment, corruption, infrastructure deficits, and environmental degradation. However, the country also possesses significant opportunities for development, including its natural resources, such as minerals, agriculture, and tourism, and its youthful population. Efforts to promote inclusive growth, improve governance, and address inequalities are key priorities for Tanzania's future.\n\nRegional and International Engagement: Tanzania plays an active role in regional and international affairs, contributing to peacekeeping missions, promoting regional integration through organizations such as the East African Community (EAC), and advocating for global issues such as climate change and sustainable development. The country has also benefited from international aid and development assistance.\n\nOverall, Tanzania's political history reflects its journey from colonialism and independence to socialism and multi-party democracy. The country's future hinges on its ability to address governance issues, promote inclusive growth, and harness its potentials for sustainable development and prosperity for all its citizens.","Flag File":"flag_Tanzania"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[39.266396,-6.798067]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Capital Id":53.0,"Capital Name":"Banjul","Country Name":"The Gambia","Country Color":"#FCAB10","Longitude":-16.5917,"Latitude":13.45388,"Capital Information":"Colonial Period: The Gambia, a small West African country, was colonized by the British in the late 19th century.

The People's Progressive Party (PPP), led by Sir Dawda Jawara, emerged as a leading force in the independence movement. Jawara became a key figure in negotiations with the British for self-governance.\nIndependence (1965): The Gambia gained independence from Britain on February 18, 1965, becoming a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations. Dawda Jawara became the country's first Prime Minister and later its first President when the Gambia became a republic in 1970.\nFirst Republic (1970-1994): Under President Jawara's leadership, The Gambia experienced a period of relative political stability and economic development. The country relied heavily on tourism and agriculture, particularly peanut farming. However, Jawara's government faced criticism for corruption, nepotism, and authoritarian tendencies.\nAttempted Coups and Authoritarian Rule: In 1981 and 1989, The Gambia experienced attempted coups against President Jawara's government. Although both coups failed, they highlighted growing dissatisfaction with Jawara's rule and his government's handling of economic and political issues.\n1994 Military Coup: In July 1994, President Jawara's government was overthrown in a bloodless military coup led by Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh, who accused Jawara's government of corruption and mismanagement. Jammeh established a military junta and suspended the constitution, promising to restore democracy and end corruption.\nJammeh's Rule (1994-2017): Yahya Jammeh ruled The Gambia for over two decades with an iron fist, suppressing political opposition, restricting press freedom, and committing human rights abuses. Despite initially promising democratic reforms, Jammeh's regime became increasingly authoritarian and repressive over time.\nDemocratic Transition (2017): In December 2016, Adama Barrow, a businessman and opposition leader, won the presidential election, defeating Yahya Jammeh, who initially refused to accept the results. Following regional pressure and mediation efforts, Jammeh eventually stepped down and went into exile, allowing for a peaceful transition of power.\nCurrent Political Landscape: Since Barrow's inauguration as president in January 2017, The Gambia has embarked on a path of democratic reform and reconciliation. The government has focused on rebuilding democratic institutions, promoting human rights, and addressing the legacy of Jammeh's authoritarian rule.

Early settlement of this region included the Ewe tribe, which is where the word “togo” originated from (meaning “lake” or “lagoon”). Although the region included a prime location on the coast, commerce was the lesser of important trades: instead, the Ewe clan found themselves in the middle of a slave trade path. In addition to the slave trade, Ewe people also faced continuous attacks from the neighboring Asante and Dahomey tribes. In 1847, German missionaries arrived to occupy the land; by 1884, a protectorate was established.\n\nEwes were relied on heavily by the Germans to help govern the region (called “Togoland”). Although there was an efficient amount of industrial growth (such as railroads, a modern town, and a jetty being built in the territory), the Germans treated the Africans terribly by forcing labor upon them. During World War 1 (1914), Togoland found itself “trapped” between French and British colonies; by the end of the war, German had surrendered control of Togoland. In 1922, The League of Nations granted for the French and British to govern the eastern and western parts of the region, respectively. This new border drew a line of tension between the Ewes, and the refusal for unification on the Europeans’ part led to riots. In 1941, the anti-French, independent political party Committee of Togolese Unity (CUT) was founded. Led by Syvlanus Olympio, CUT won the election leading to independence in 1958, and in 1960, Togo gained its independence.\n\nTogo’s first president, Syvlanus Olympio, still maintained an economic relationship with France. Togo also joined the Organization of African Unity, which gave cooperation (political, economic, and social) to French-speaking African states. In 1963, President Olympio was assassinated during a military coup led by Gnassingbe Eyadema; Eyadema would continue to lead military coups until he seized power in 1967, when he put an end to all political parties. Eyadema created his own political party, Rally of the Togolese People, in 1969, and in less than 20 years later, elections were held again. As the only opponent, Eyadema won the presidency. For nearly 40 years, President Eyadema led Togo until his death in 2005.\n\nPresident Eyadema’s son, Faure Gnassingbe Eyadema, was appointed as the president by the military. He went on to win the next few elections (2010, 2015, and 2020), which were all met with unfavorable reactions by the opposition (resulting in protests and riots). Nonetheless, he still remains as Togo’s president, with the potential chance to keep his role in office until 2030. Togo continues to build a stable country with a good economy. Although this country is one of the top five producers of phosphates (used for fertilizers), they still require assistance for foreign aid. The country has also often been criticized for their political governance, although the transition from a single-party to a multi-party democracy has been notable.","Flag File":"flag_Togo"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.220811,6.133883]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Capital Id":55.0,"Capital Name":"Tunis","Country Name":"Tunisia","Country Color":"#FCAB10","Longitude":10.17968,"Latitude":36.80278,"Capital Information":"Archaeological evidence has shown that some of the first people to inhabit the North African country of Tunisia were Homo-sapiens of the Capsian culture, and many Berber tribes, including the Libyans, Butr and Baranis.

Berber culture was The Carthaginian Empire fought the Roman Republic for control of land in the Western Mediterranean in a series of wars called the Punic Wars, which lasted from 264 BC to 146 BC. The Romans won the Punic Wars, destroyed the city of Carthage and enslaved the Tunisians. The Romans called Tunisia “Ifriqiyyah,” the Roman word for “Africa.”\n\n \nTunisia was colonized by the French via the Treaty of Bardo, which was signed in 1881. However, the Tunisians’ culture, government and land were still preserved. There were also steps taken in Tunisia for modern forms of communication. For example, a group called the “Young Tunisians” created a newspaper called Le Tunisien.  \n\n \nTunisia went through several periods of political unease in order to gain independence from the French. The Destour, or Constitution, Party, formed in 1920, fought for Tunisi-ans to have the same rights as Europeans, but were unsuccessful. In 1934, the Neo-Destour party was born from several young members of the Destour party, causing ten-sion between both the Destour and Neo-Destour parties. The Neo-Destour party be-came the leading political party in Tunisia in 1937, led by Habib Bourguiba, who would later become the first president of Tunisia in 1957. The Neo-Destour party started a re-bellion in 1953, after experiencing harassment from French authorities during the 1940s.

Early settlement, specifically of the Bantu group, traces back to 1000 BCE, and powerful empires were developed between the 17th and 18th centuries. The Buganda Kingdom was the most notable kingdom to have originated in Uganda’s area, and their prominence remains in modern times today. During the Scramble for Africa (period during which European powers sought to conquer land in Africa), Britain and Germany went against one another for the colonization of Uganda. Eventually, the British prevailed, and in 1894 Uganda was declared a protectorate by the British.\n\nThe British and the Kingdom of Buganda (still the most powerful kingdom at the time) settled on the Buganda Agreement of 1900, which entailed that relations were to be held for at least 50 years. During this colonization, Uganda experienced tremendous commercial opportunities through the trades of goods such as coffee and tea; this led to Uganda growing into one of the more rich and stable African colonies. Countries such as Ghana and Nigeria experienced similar growth that gradually led to their independence, and Uganda pursued that same path. After the development of a political party system, Uganda started to self-govern themselves; on October 9, 1962, Uganda was granted independence from Great Britain.\n\nThe first president of Uganda was Sir Edward Mutesa, the Kabaka (King) of Buganda; in 1967, Prime Minister Milton Obote created a new constitution that declared Uganda as a Republic, and soon became president. President Omote was overthrown by the military leader Idi Amin, who had given false hope in unifying the country. Instead, his incompetence to run a government led to hundreds of thousands dying during his rule; after having Tanzania retaliate against his invasion, Amin fled the country and Omote returned to presidency. However, he was again overthrown during a coup, and the rebel leader Yoweri Museveni became president in 1986; he has been leading Uganda since then.\n\nPresident Museveni has spent most of his presidency focused on economic reconstruction, in addition to establishing a policy of morality that saw a progression in security and human rights. While Museveni did prioritize uplifting women, this policy unfortunately did not support gay rights, shown when the president signed an anti-homosexuality bill in 2014. In addition to the one particular problem, the country has faced issues such as rebel activity, high unemployment, and consistent corruption, it has been praised for its economic growth, fight for human rights, and stability.
